# Atmospheric retrieval scripts for Balmer et al. 2022a (in prep.)

This code will reproduce the ```petitRADTRANS``` spectral retrievals presented in the paper, and the repository hosts the necessary data (the observations) used in the paper. The code requires the ```species``` package, and the retrievals are computationally intensive.
